		Node JS
- Node Js is a server side platform.
- Built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine [V8].
- Open Source, Cross-platform runtime environement  for developing server-side and networking applications.
- It is javascript based server side technology.
- Node JS application can run on any OS
	[Windows, Linux, Mac]

Features of Node JS
=================
1. Asynchronous 
2. Modular Approach
3. Leight weight
4. Faster
5. No Buffering

Install Node JS
=============
1. Visit
	https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Download and Install MSI for windows

3. Test in command prompt
	>node -v

Node JS Program Structure
=======================
1. Node JS programs are JavaScript programs that run server side. They must have the extention ".js"

2. Node Compiler is used to compile and  run NodeJS program.
	>node program.js

3. You have to use JavaScript in node js only as language not for DOM manipulation.
	- Variables
	- DataTypes
	- Operators
	- Statements
	- Functions
	- Modules
          REPL
	- R	Read
	- E	Execute
	- P	Print
	- L	Loop

4. A Typical Node JS program comprises of  following stages

      a) Download and Install required library from NPM
      b) Import the library into program by using the
          function "require()"
      c) You can implement the functionality for members in the library.


Ex: Write a server side program in Node Js to read content from a file and print on console.

1. In order to read / write data into files you need a library "fs" [file stream] in Node JS.
               > npm install fs
    The library will be installed into project and its files are stored in "node_modules" folder.

2. Create a new JavaScript file server side
	            "demo.js"
//Import Library
var fs = require("fs");

//Reading with Synchronous Approach

var data = fs.readFileSync("../help.txt");
console.log(data.toString());
console.log("Read Completed...");

3. Compile and Run
	> node demo.js

Ex: Asynchronous - Un Blocking

	         unblocking.js
	         ===========
var fs = require("fs");

//Read by using Asynchronous Approach

fs.readFile("../help.txt", function(err, data){
    if(!err) {
        console.log(data.toString());
    } else {
        console.log(err);
    }
})
console.log("Read Completed...");
