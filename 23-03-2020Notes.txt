- Routing in angular is a technqiue which is not completely stable.

- Modules required for handling routes in Angular

	a) Routes
	b) RouterModule

- The library for routing is defined in "@angular/router"

- "Routes" is used to configure the routes for angular application.

- "RouterModule" is used handle the routes like loding routes into route table and verifying the route references.

- Routes are configured in a special file [Reserved file]
	      "app-routing.module.ts"
		[app folder]

- Routes are created by using "Routes" module in "app-routing.module.ts"
 
            const   routes : Routes = [
                  {
                     path:
	   component:
	   redirectTo:
	   outlet:
	   pathMatch:
	   children:
                  },
                  {
                  }
             ]

FAQ: Why routes are configured with "const"?
A.  Every route must be initialized because it is defined in configuration phase. 
      In configuration there can't be declaration and rendering, there must be only initialization.
      Routes once configured can't be shadowed i.e can't be redefined.

Router Module
============
  It provides a set of properties and methods that are used to export and load the routes into route table. It implements "ngModule" base.

Syntax:
    @ngModule({
         imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
         exports: [RouterModule]
     })


Route Directives:
1. routerLink     : It is used to create a hyperlink that
	           navigates to specified route by using
	           the route path.

   Syntax:
     <a routerLink="path"> Text </a>
