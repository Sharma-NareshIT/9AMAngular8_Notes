	            RxJS
- Reactive Extention for JavaScript [RxJs].
- It is a library that provides asynchronous technique to handle various interactions in an application.
- Asynchronous means un-locking [un-blocking]
- It provides various functions that are responsible for handling asynchrous responses.
- It is a recative extention for javascript which handles mapping, filtering, iterating like operations on data.
- To make the data interactions asynchronous you can use RxJs library.
- The major components of RxJs library used for anync tasks are

Component	Description
===========================================
Observable	It represents a type of an
		invokable collection for 
		identifying the type of data
		returned on request.
		It is a function that creates
		an observer and identifies
		the expected value. It gets the
		data from Http Request.

Observer		It is  collection of callback that
		know how to listen to the value
		delivered by observable.

Subscription	It represent the execution of
		an observable and also 
		responsible for canceling the
		execution.

Operators		It provides a set of functions
		that enable the operation like
		map, filtering, contact etc..

Subject		It is similar to event emmiter
		that emmits the values based on
		specific state in application.

Schedules	They are use to perform any
		task at scheduled time intervals.
		


	        Angular HttpClient
	       ================
- Angular provides an HttpClient module that internally uses XmlHttpRequest object to handle http request from client.

Q. How client side technolgoies consume the data from an API and get the data from JSON format?

	JavaScript  uses	XmlHttpRequest obj
	JQuery	   uses	$.getJson()
	Angular Js  uses	$http()
	Angular	   uses	HttpClient module

 Internally all client side technologies are using "XmlHttpRequest".

- HttpClient is provided by Angular and uses to manage various requests from client.

- It includes GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc..
- HttpClient module is available in 
	"@angular/common/http"



http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/getProducts  - API to get all
			             form database.
subscribe(function(url, data){
       return data;
  })
 subscribe(data => this.products = data)
