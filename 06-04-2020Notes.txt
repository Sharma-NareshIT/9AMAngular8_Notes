	               Middleware 
	                [Express]
- It is a software framework that enables communication between tiers in a multi tier application.
- Communication between webserver, application server and Database server.
- Express is a middleware that allows to create RESTful service requests with any server side technology to handle request from client and send a response.

Distributed Computing:
===================
   It is an software architecture that allows communication between 2 applications running in 2 differents mechines or 2 applications running in same mechine but different process.
Ex:
CORBA
-Common Object Request Broken Architecture
RMI
-Remote Method Invocation
DCOM
-Distribute Component Object Model
Java Beans
Web Services ** known to all technolgoies
Remoting 

WebService Specifications:
1. SOAP
     - Service Oriented Architecture Protocol
     - The request from client will be in XML
     - The response from server will be in XML
     - It uses WSDL, UDDI

2. REST
     - Representation State Transfer
     - Request will be in simple Query
     - Response will be in XML and optionally JSON

3. JSON
     - JavaScript Object Notation
     - Request and Response will be in JSON
     - JSON is native to every brower

express()	- Requests are handled 

Request		Description
------------------------------------------------------------------
GET	 To fetch resource
POST	  To submit resource
PUT	  To modify the resource
DELETE	  To remove the resource

Server Objects:
1. Request Object 
    It is used by server to request details from client. like query string, cookies, files, forms etc.

2. Response Object
    It is used by server to send a response to client. like file response, json response, xml response, cookie etc..

1. Install Express:
 > npm install express

2. Create a program "server.js"

var express = require("express");

var app = express();   // Express class

app.get("/", function(request, response){
    response.send("<h2>API - Home </h2>");
})

app.get("/products", function(request, response){
    response.send("<h2>Products List</h2>");
})

app.get("/c*t", function(request, response){
    response.send("<h2>You requested wild card path eg: contact</h2>");
})
app.listen(8080);
console.log("Server Started Listening : http://127.0.0.1:8080");
